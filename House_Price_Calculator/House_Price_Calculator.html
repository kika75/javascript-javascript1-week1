        <h1>Hello. Welcome to your best house-price-calculating website!</h1>
        <p>We know it's hard to make decisions. Especially ones that costs us for years to come. The kind we can't put in a draw, under the carpet, wrapped in blanket and in a box somewhere deep in your aunt's uncharted basement. No, we are talking about one of the biggest decision of your adult life - BUYING A HOUSE.<br>With the help of our calculator, you will be able to roughly estimate what a realistic price for a house would be given its dimensions. We are yet to develop a program that can compute variables such as annoying neibor index, early birds chirping at 4 AM (on Sundays too), traffic and pollution coefficient,proximity of like-minded groups and individuals, number of sightet rainbows/annum, weird cats, grumpy dogs, mosquitos volume, loud-music, loud-and-bad music, distance to shopping, distance to everything else, and the list goes on...<br>In any case, we wish you the BEST OF LUCK with your house-buying and hope you are very happy you checked us out first!</p>
